# Smart Watering System

A smart plant watering system built with ESP32 microcontroller and Flutter mobile application. This system monitors soil moisture levels and controls a water pump automatically to maintain optimal plant hydration.

## Features

- ðŸŒ± Real-time soil moisture monitoring
- ðŸ’§ Automatic and manual pump control
- ðŸŒ™ Dark/Light theme support
- ðŸ“± Mobile app interface
- ðŸ“Š Status monitoring and notifications
- ðŸ”Œ WiFi connectivity status
- ðŸ”„ MQTT communication
